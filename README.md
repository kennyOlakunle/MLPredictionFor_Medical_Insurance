# Machine Learning Prediction for Medical Insurance using Supervised Learning with Linear Regression Model
## Context
Nowadays, medical insurance is becoming a necessity for many people. Depending on the medicalcare, insurance companies collect annual premiums. It is difficult to estimate the medical expenses 
due to various health conditions of payees. Some conditions are, however, more prevalent for certain segments of the population. For instance, lung cancer is more likely among smokers than 
non-smokers, and heart disease may be more likely among the obese. 

As a result, insurers invest a great deal of time and money to develop models that accurately forecast medical expenses.
### Objectives
The aim of this task is to analyse and use machine learning to build a prediction model to estimate the medical cost of individuals based on the predicters given in the dataset. The factors include age,sex, BMI(Body Mass Index), children, smoker, region, and the medicalCost. This will help answer some questions which would be asked in the analysis.
